Please provide the following information in writing:
<br/>
<br/>   (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
    <br/>   (ii) Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and an electronic mail;
    <br/>   (iii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site) and your interest or right with respect to that work(s) ;
    <br/>   (iv) Identification of the Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the Content;
    <br/>   (v)Specify the nature of the infringement that is alleged;
    <br/>   (vi)Specify the date and time of alleged infringement;
    <br/>   (vii) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (Copyright Act of Canada); and
    <br/>   (viii) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
<br/><br/>
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 6(A), your Copyright Infringement notice may not be valid.  To expedite our ability to process your request, such written notice should be sent to our designated agent via our online complaint form by clicking on the “Report copyright infringement” feature found on the Website whenever there is Content available for download. You may also utilize the “Report copyright infringement” feature to report other abuses such as trademark infringement, privacy violations, and harassment. SowndHaus.audio reserves the right to investigate all claims and apply a subjective good faith decision on their validity; "bogus claims", "copyfraud", "misrepresentation of copyright" or other invalid notifications may be subject to legal action.
<br/><br/>
<strong>B. Notice and Notice.</strong> If SowndHaus.audio receives a valid notification of alleged Copyright Infringement about Content uploaded to your account SowndHaus will, under our obligations in the Notice and Notice regime (Copyright Modernization Act, Canada), forward the infringement notification to you via electronic mail and we will inform the complaining party that this has been done.
<br/><br/>
Receiving a notice does not necessarily mean that you have in fact infringed copyright, or that you will be sued for copyright infringement, or that your account at SowndHaus is affected in any way.<br/>
The Notice and Notice regime does not impose any obligations on a subscriber who receives a notice and it does not require the subscriber to contact the copyright owner or SowndHaus.<br/>
The information provided by the copyright owner should help you understand the details of the alleged infringement.
<br/><br/>
SowndHaus will go above and beyond our legal obligations under the Notice And Notice regime to investigate the alleged infringing Content and make a determination, in good faith, and at it's sole discretion, whether infringement under the Copyright Act of Canada and the Copyright Modernization Act (Canada) has taken place.<br/> 
If we believe, in good faith, the Content does not have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, and is not authorized by the law, the Content will be removed from our servers without prior warning and in accordance with these Terms (5.D).
